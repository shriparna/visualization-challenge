## Analysis

- There is a positive correlation between the weight of the mouse and the tumor volume. Tumor volume was found to be higher in the heavy mice and it was lower in the skinny mice
- Capomulin and Ramicane drugs found to be more potent as it restricted the tumor volume in mice treated with these drugs. 
- When treated with Capomulin, the tumor volume is first increased and then there is a sharp decrease but it spikes again and the pattern continues
